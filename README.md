# Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions to 2020's [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

I solve the problems with purely functional Scala and the Typelevel ecosystem.
In particular, I try to use streaming solutions where possible because I think
it's an elegant and efficient paradigm, but also to get more familiar with fs2.

## Improvements and bugs

If you've found an improvement to one of my solutions or a bug, please share!
I'd love to discuss and learn :)
